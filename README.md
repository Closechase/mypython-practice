# mypython-practice
You've already seen and used functions such as print and abs. But Python has many more functions, and defining your own functions is a big part of python programming.

In this lesson, you will learn more about using and defining functions.

Getting Help
You saw the abs function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?

The help() function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. If you can remember how to use help(), you hold the key to understanding most other functions.

Here is an example:

help(round)
Help on built-in function round in module builtins:

round(number, ndigits=None)
    Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits.
    
    The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None.  Otherwise
    the return value has the same type as the number.  ndigits may be negative.

help() displays two things:

the header of that function round(number, ndigits=None). In this case, this tells us that round() takes an argument we can describe as number. Additionally, we can optionally give a separate argument which could be described as ndigits.
A brief English description of what the function does.
Common pitfall: when you're looking up a function, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and not the result of calling that function.

What happens if we invoke help on a call to the function round()? Unhide the output of the cell below to see.

help(round(-2.01))
Help on int object:

class int(object)
 |  int([x]) -> integer
 |  int(x, base=10) -> integer
 |  
 |  Convert a number or string to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments
 |  are given.  If x is a number, return x.__int__().  For floating point
 |  numbers, this truncates towards zero.
 |  
 |  If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,
 |  bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in the
 |  given base.  The literal can be preceded by '+' or '-' and be surrounded
 |  by whitespace.  The base defaults to 10.  Valid bases are 0 and 2-36.
 |  Base 0 means to interpret the base from the string as an integer literal.
 |  >>> int('0b100', base=0)

Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of round(-2.01), then it provides help on the output of that expression.

(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the help output above will make more sense.)

round is a very simple function with a short docstring. help shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like print. Don't worry if the following output looks inscrutable... for now, just see if you can pick anything new out from this help.

help(print)
Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

print(...)
    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
    
    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
    Optional keyword arguments:
    file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
    sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
    end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
    flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.

If you were looking for it, you might learn that print can take an argument called sep, and that this describes what we put between all the other arguments when we print them.

Defining functions
Builtin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.

def least_difference(a, b, c):
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
This creates a function called least_difference, which takes three arguments, a, b, and c.

Functions start with a header introduced by the def keyword. The indented block of code following the : is run when the function is called.

return is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a return statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.

Is it clear what least_difference() does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:

print(
    least_difference(1, 10, 100),
    least_difference(1, 10, 10),
    least_difference(5, 6, 7), # Python allows trailing commas in argument lists. How nice is that?
)
9 0 1
Or maybe the help() function can tell us something about it.

help(least_difference)
Help on function least_difference in module __main__:

least_difference(a, b, c)

Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the docstring.

Docstrings
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.
    
    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. When we call help() on a function, it shows the docstring.

help(least_difference)
Help on function least_difference in module __main__:

least_difference(a, b, c)
    Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.
    
    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4

Aside: The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The >>> is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example, see this docstring for the numpy function np.eye.

Good programmers use docstrings unless they expect to throw away the code soon after it's used (which is rare). So, you should start writing docstrings, too!

Functions that don't return
What would happen if we didn't include the return keyword in our function?

def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
    
print(
    least_difference(1, 10, 100),
    least_difference(1, 10, 10),
    least_difference(5, 6, 7),
)
None None None

Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value None. (This is similar to the concept of "null" in other languages.)

Without a return statement, least_difference is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: print() and help() don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.

mystery = print()
print(mystery)
None


Default arguments
When we called help(print), we saw that the print function has several optional arguments. For example, we can specify a value for sep to put some special string in between our printed arguments:

print(1, 2, 3, sep=' < ')
1 < 2 < 3
But if we don't specify a value, sep is treated as having a default value of ' ' (a single space).

print(1, 2, 3)
1 2 3
Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:

def greet(who="Colin"):
    print("Hello,", who)
    
greet()
greet(who="Kaggle")
# (In this case, we don't need to specify the name of the argument, because it's unambiguous.)
greet("world")
Hello, Colin
Hello, Kaggle
Hello, world
Functions Applied to Functions
Here's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first. You can supply functions as arguments to other functions. Some example may make this clearer:

def mult_by_five(x):
    return 5 * x

def call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on arg"""
    return fn(arg)

def squared_call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on the result of calling fn on arg"""
    return fn(fn(arg))

print(
    call(mult_by_five, 1),
    squared_call(mult_by_five, 1), 
    sep='\n', # '\n' is the newline character - it starts a new line
)
5
25
Functions that operate on other functions are called "higher-order functions." You probably won't write your own for a little while. But there are higher-order functions built into Python that you might find useful to call.

Here's an interesting example using the max function.

By default, max returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional key argument, it returns the argument x that maximizes key(x) (aka the 'argmax').

def mod_5(x):
    """Return the remainder of x after dividing by 5"""
    return x % 5

print(
    'Which number is biggest?',
    max(100, 51, 14),
    'Which number is the biggest modulo 5?',
    max(100, 51, 14, key=mod_5),
    sep='\n',
)
Which number is biggest?
100
Which number is the biggest modulo 5?
14
